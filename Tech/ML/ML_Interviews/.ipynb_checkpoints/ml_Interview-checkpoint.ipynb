    "### Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning ?\n",

    "### Supervised learning is when each example of dataset is labeled. For example, in classifying between a dog and cat, each training example will mention the label that whether it is a cat or a dog. \n",
    "### On the other hand, in Unsupervised learning each example has no such label. Clustering is a technique which is most widely used in unsupervised learning tasks to group data points which have the same attributes. \n",

Semi-supervised helps in this aspect because it can learn from few labeled examples and then label rest of the un-labeled examples. \n",
